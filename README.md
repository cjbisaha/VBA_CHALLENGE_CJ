# VBA_CHALLENGE_CJ

Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

	I prepared a workbook for Steve that at a click of a button can analyze an entire dataset. This was so 
	that Steve could do more research for his parents on the stocks over the past few years. I will be refracting 
	code from the module 2 assignment to loop that makes the VBA script run faster since the data includes thousands of rows.  






Results: 

	As you can see from the images, 2017 was a much more succcesful return rate than 2018. Almost every
	stock had a positive outlook except TERP. In 2018, it was a much different story. I found the return rate
	to be negative for every stock except ENPH and RUN. TERP had a negative return in 2017 and 2018. 

	Refracting the code made the data run much faster. The code ran in 0.109375 seconds in 2017 and 0.09375 
	seconds in 2018. Considering there was 3000+ rows of data, we can see that it took around 1/10 of a second
	to get the results we wanted. Very Fast!


Summary: 

	Some advantages of refracting code is that it can be way more time efficent, it can use less memory as well as
	making the code more logical for future users. 

	Some disadvantages of refracting code can incluse risk of bugs when the application is so large, exesting code
	is not properly lapeled or has errors, users do not understand the code and it can take time up front when looking
	for a "quick" solution. 




How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?


	Refactoring the original VBA showed results of a quicker return run time. Although it was nothing crazy in this excercise, 
	due to 3000 rows. If it were a data sheet with tens of thousands rows of data I believe we would see a larger difference in 
	run time. Many hours were speant for me to refactor the code only to shave off a second of time. I beleive refracting took way
	too much time (maybe I am just slow at it :) ) to be worth it for this excersice.
